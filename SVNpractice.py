#my name is Shane Andrews <- wanted to say Tyler Durden haha

#new stuff to say what this is for. i just learned the hard way, emphasis on "hard", how to get a file into an existing SVN repository
#modify it and get it pushed out to the server i.e. github in this case. the trick was figuring out what "views" were for what
#and to update and then commit. Synchronize view finally did the trick for me. now for some hello world action

print "Hello World!";
